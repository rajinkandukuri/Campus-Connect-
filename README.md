# Campus Connect â€” GitHub Pages Ready

This folder contains your updated website with an attribution line added to each page footer.

## âœ… What changed
- Added attribution: *"Logos and trademarks belong to their respective owners. Used for educational and informational purposes only."*
- Removed the `file://...` **Back** link from `index.html` so it works on GitHub Pages.
- Included `Images/README.txt` as a placeholder (upload your actual images into `Images/`).

## ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure
```
